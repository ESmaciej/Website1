        <p>During my ixd101 semester, I was prompted to create a website relating to a specific designer. My choice was Saul Bass as he created moving images that were the first of its kind and was awesome. During the creation of this website I faced certain difficulties which I was able to overcome, these included the images not fitting together into one row and the table text being very squashed for the hyperlinks. In the end, I chose a dark colour scheme to make it less straining on the eyes and chose a colourful scheme around the images, hyperlinks and other entities which made the website itself resemble the soul of Saul Bass' work. To make my website stand out, I decided to test out a small GIF which I made sure didnt slow down the loading time. After I confirmed loading time wasnt affected heavily, I quickly implemented it into my website through researching what is necessary for a GIF to work with a website.</p>

    <!-- ABOUT ME SPLIT INTO PARAGRAPHS TO MAKE EASIER READABILITY -->

        <p style="font-size:1.3vw;">I have a passion for all aspects of art and love looking at nature photography. In all my work I try to be a futurist through technology, youth and violence in my work. This, however, usually means I am left taking content out of my work as opposed to adding more.</p>  

        <p style="font-size:1.3vw;">In my free time I love exploring, looking at innovations and a variety of designers (especially Saul Bass) who teach me new ways to look at the world. This is amongst a handful of other crafts I love commercing with including boxing, swimming, cycling, designing, thinking about the future and getting lost in my thoughts.</p> 

        <p style="font-size:1.3vw;">Elon Musk once stated that, "To make an embarrassing admission, I like video games. That's what got me into software engineering when I was a kid. I wanted to make money so I could buy a better computer to play better video games - nothing like saving the world." It illustrates how much anything can change at a given time which I feel can be true to my purpose of designing.</p>
